    "## What is Data Mining?\n",
    "Data mining is the science of analyzing data to gain insight, draw conclusions, or make decisions about the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "What are examples of data in the real-world and how is that data being analyzed?\n",
    "* Medical data collected from electronic health records, physician/nurse notes, etc.\n",
    "    * Analyzed to determine health risk factors, onset of early disease, insurance billing, etc.\n",
    "* Time series data collected from sensors installed in the environment or worn on the body (wearables)\n",
    "    * Analyzed to detect physical activity, daily behavior, changes in behavior over time, etc.\n",
    "* Social media data collected from social networks, posting, news feeds, etc.\n",
    "    * Analyzed to suggest friends, deliver user-specific content, recommend products, target advertising, etc.\n",
    "* Financial data collected from banking transactions, trading, etc.\n",
    "    * Analyzed to project stock market trends, recommend certain investments, determine credit scores, etc.\n",
    "* Many others\n",
    "\n",
    "Some topics related to data analytics that we will cover in this class (at a high level) includes the following:\n",
    "* [Data representation/cleaning/munging/wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling): Describes the overall process of manipulating unstructured and/or messy data into a structured and clean form.\n",
    "* [Data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining): The computational process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems. The overall goal of the data mining process is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use.\n",
    "* [Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning): Provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can change when exposed to new data."

    "## Python\n",
    "In this class, we are going to learn and use the Python programming language for all of our coding assignments. According to [IEEE Spectrum](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2016-top-programming-languages), Python is a top 3 programming language of 2016 and according to [KDNuggets](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/08/four-main-languages-analytics-data-mining-data-science.html), Python is a top two programming language for analytics, data mining, and data science (second only to R). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Programming for Data Mining?\n",
    "* Faster than analyzing by hand (especially for large data)!\n",
    "* Reuse other data, same data different params/settings\n",
    "* Enables a form of “repeatability” (and ideally, transparency)\n",
    "    * can repeat “experiment” and get the same result\n",
    "    * no “magic” steps\n",
    "* Still important, however, to write down steps (log)\n",
    "    * ideally, someone should be able to take your data, program, and description of steps, rerun everything, and get the same results!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Python for Data Mining?\n",
    "Advantages of learning Python include:\n",
    "1. Easy to learn\n",
    "1. Free, open source\n",
    "1. Support for the life cycle of software (prototyping, development, testing, release, maintenance)\n",
    "1. Many available libraries, especially for data analytics:\n",
    "    1. [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)\n",
    "    1. [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)\n",
    "    1. [sci-kits](https://scikits.appspot.com/) (especially [sci-kit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for machine learning)\n",
    "    1. [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)\n",
    "    1. [Plotting libraries](https://wiki.python.org/moin/NumericAndScientific/Plotting), such as [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [Plotly](https://plot.ly/)\n",
    "1. Many supported GUI backends\n",
    "1. LOTS of community support/development online\n",
    "1. Cross platform support\n",
    "    * Python is an interpreted language, which means it can run on any system with the Python interpreter installed; however, this is also a disadvantage in some ways, meaning Python code can be slow to run, compared with compiled languages like C\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Python Distribution and IDE\n",
    "We will use the [Anaconda v3.7](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index) Python3 distribution. This is a free distribution of Python version 3 available for Windows, OS X, and Linux. You can download Anaconda3 [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and view the installation instructions [here](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install).\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda comes packaged with an easy-to-use integrated development environment (IDE) called [Spyder](http://spyder-ide.org/) (Scientific Python Development Environment) and (optionally) [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I encourage you to use Spyder or Visual Studio Code (or one of the following [Anaconda-supported IDEs](https://support.anaconda.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2880333-using-an-ide-with-anaconda) to develop your Python code)."
